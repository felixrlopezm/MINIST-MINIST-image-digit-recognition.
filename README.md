# MINIST-MINIST-image-digit-recognition.

Project for the Udacity Nanodegree program: Deep Learning. A first neural network for predicting daily bike rental ridership.

In this project and in the framework of the aformentioned Udacity nanodegree program, I build a neural network to carry out a prediction about daily bike rental ridership on a real dataset! I apply forwardpass gradient descent, backpropagation and other related concepts directly with python code (and without using any other higher-level tool such as PyTorch).

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset

The network is trained and used by means of a Jupyter Notebook written in python: "Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb"

The neural network itself is built in the pytho file: "my_answers.py"

This code creates and trains an MLP fully connected network to make predictions about a handwriten digit image type from MNIST dataset. Then, it predicts the probability of an input image to be any from 0 to 9 digits.

More about MNIST dataset (National Institute of Standards and Technology) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database

This code is an evolution of the code originally developed in the framework of the Module 2, Neural Networks, Lesson 7, Deep learning with PyTorch, of the Udacity NanoDegree program Deep Learning


#How to install and run the code
Just clone the repository in your working directory, open the Jupyter Notebook and run it.
