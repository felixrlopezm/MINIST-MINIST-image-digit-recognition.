# MINIST Image Digit Recognition MPL Neural Network

This code creates and trains an MLP fully connected network (three layers) to make predictions about a handwriten digit image type from MNIST dataset. Then, it predicts the probability of an input image to be any from 0 to 9 digits.

This code is an evolution of the code originally developed in the framework of the Module 2, Neural Networks, Lesson 7, Deep learning with PyTorch, of the Udacity NanoDegree program Deep Learning


# How to install and run the code
Just clone the repository in your working directory, open the Jupyter Notebook and run it.
